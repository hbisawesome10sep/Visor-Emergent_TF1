### v3.1 Changes (March 22, 2026)
- [x] **Groww Stock Statement Support**: ISIN → NSE/BSE ticker resolution via yfinance. All 26 stocks resolved correctly. Tickers cached in DB after first resolution.
- [x] **Zerodha Multi-Sheet Statement Support**: Parses Equity, Mutual Funds, and Combined sheets from a single Zerodha XLSX. Stocks get `.NS` tickers, MFs get ISIN for NAV lookup. Correctly skips Combined sheet when specific sheets are available.
- [x] **Category Detection Fix**: Sheet name takes priority over statement_type for multi-sheet files (Equity sheet → Stock, MF sheet → Mutual Fund).
- [x] **MF Ticker Fix**: Mutual Funds now always use ISIN for NAV lookup (mfapi.in) instead of the fund name from Symbol column.
- [x] **ISIN Fallback for Failed Tickers**: When a stock ticker fails in yfinance (e.g., hyphenated `TATAGOLD-E`), falls back to ISIN resolution (TATAGOLD-E → INF277KA1976 → TATAGOLD.NS).
- [x] **Bank Statement Upload Fix**: Missing `detect_header_columns` import in `pdf_parsers.py` fixed.
- [x] **HDFC Bank Statement Parser Overhaul**:
  - Multi-line narration collection (was only reading first line, missing UPI ID/merchant info)
  - `clean_hdfc_description()` rewritten with 15+ transaction type handlers
  - Generic "UPI Transfer" reduced from 322 to 0 occurrences
  - Reference numbers extracted and stored for deduplication
  - Known merchant detection (50+ Indian merchants: Swiggy, Zomato, Cred, Amazon, etc.)
- [x] **Duplicate Detection Fixed**: Now uses ref_number (unique per bank txn) instead of aggressive description[:30] matching. Result: 433 of 456 imported (was ~50 before).
- [x] **Auto-Categorization Enhanced**: Added Credit Card (Cred, Slice), Entertainment (Dream11), Transport (Mumbai Metro), UPI Payment (Paytm, PhonePe), Transfer fallback for person-to-person UPI.
- [x] **Portfolio Overview Card Scaling**: Added `numberOfLines={1}` + `adjustsFontSizeToFit` to prevent text wrapping on smaller screens.
- [x] **SIP Date Picker iOS Fix**: Increased picker height from 130px to 200px to show year column on iOS.
- [x] **Flippable Investment Summary Card**: Dashboard Investment card now flips to show:
  - Asset allocation breakdown with horizontal bars
  - AI-generated daily investment insight (GPT-4o, cached 24h)
- [x] **Investment Amount Alignment**: Dashboard Overview "Investments" card now uses `portfolio_invested` (from holdings) instead of transaction-based total, aligning with Investment Summary Card.
- [x] **Bank Statement Parser Refinements (Session Mar 22, 2026)**:
  - ICICI: Complete text-extraction rewrite for interleaved blocks
  - SBI: Rewrote `clean_sbi_description` to prevent truncation
  - Union Bank: Multi-line continuation extraction (e.g., `/Salary`)
  - Axis Bank: Handle "F07 Cred", Card Charges, bypass payment gateways
  - PNB: Fixed NEFT company name indices, RTGS/cheque cleanup
  - **Canara Bank**: Fully rewrote `clean_canara_description` — RTGS/NEFT now extract actual company names via IFSC regex, IMPS shows bank+last4, cheque returns show payee, all 51 test transactions clean
  - **Bank of Baroda**: Complete rewrite of `parse_bob_pdf` — switched from text-based to TABLE extraction for ground-truth debit/credit columns (fixing 8+ wrong debit/credit classifications). Added gap-filling text pass for page-boundary entries. Rewrote `clean_bob_description` for UPI, NEFT, ACH-DR, ECS, NRP, IMPS patterns. CredClub→Cred. 25/25 transactions verified, balance matches to the penny (25,073.92).
  - **Kotak Bank**: Complete rewrite of `parse_kotak_text_format` — switched to word-position-based column extraction with **balance-delta** approach. pdfplumber's (Dr)/(Cr) suffixes were unreliable due to multi-line column alignment issues, so amounts and debit/credit are now computed from balance differences. Rewrote `clean_kotak_description` to cleanly extract UPI payees without Chq/Ref column noise. 43/43 transactions verified, balance matches exactly (11,406.54).
  - **Bank Detection Fix**: Added Canara, Union, IDBI to `detect_bank` priority patterns (was misdetecting Canara as HDFC). Added BARB0 IFSC pattern for BOB detection (was falling to Yes Bank). Added "cust.reln.no" for Kotak (bank name not present in statement text).
  - **Categorization Fix**: Fixed "cred" keyword false-positive on "credit" (Clearing Credit no longer miscategorized as Credit Card). Added IMPS/cheque/RTGS charges to Bank Charges category
- [x] **Clear All Transactions Feature** (Mar 22, 2026):
  - Backend: `DELETE /api/clear-all-transactions` — clears all transactions, credit card transactions, bank accounts, journal entries, statement hashes
  - Frontend: "Data Management" section in Settings > Banking with red "Clear All Transactions" button + confirmation dialog with detailed warning
- [x] **Credit Card Benefits Tab** (Mar 22, 2026):
  - Backend: `GET /api/credit-cards/{card_id}/benefits` (AI-powered via GPT-5.2) + `GET /api/credit-cards/all-benefits`
  - Frontend: New "Benefits" tab in Credit Cards screen with expand/collapse per card, "Fetch Benefits with AI" button, cached benefits display with category icons, AI disclaimer
  - Benefits cached in `card_benefits_cache` MongoDB collection to avoid repeated AI calls
- [x] **Dashboard Financial Year & Date Range Fix** (Mar 22, 2026):
  - 'Y' toggle now shows Indian Financial Year (April 1 – March 31) instead of calendar year. Header and date indicator display "FY 2025-26" format
  - Backend: `/api/dashboard/stats` accepts `frequency` param. When `frequency=Year` (or date span >120 days), trend data groups by month (labels: Apr, May, …) instead of weekly
  - Custom date range picker `minimumDate` changed from `userCreatedAt` (was limiting to Feb 2026) to January 1, 2020, so users can pick dates back to 2020
  - Trend Analysis X-axis shows month labels (Apr, May, Jun, …) for full FY when Y is selected
- [x] **Transaction Summary Double-Counting Bug Fix** (Mar 22, 2026):
  - Root cause: Transactions API had `.to_list(500)` cap while Dashboard had `.to_list(1000)`. User with 982 transactions (711 HDFC + 271 SBI) saw correct totals on Dashboard but only half on Transactions screen
  - Fix: Increased list limits to 5000 on both endpoints, AND added server-side `GET /api/transactions/summary` using MongoDB aggregation for accurate totals regardless of list size
  - Frontend transactions screen now uses server-side summary for the Income/Expenses/Net bar
